# DevDojo Themes Package

This is a package that will add theme support in your Laravel application

## Adding Themes

The **themes** package will look inside of the `resources/themes` folder for any folder that has a `.json` file inside of it with the same name. *(You can change the theme folder location in the config)*

As an example if you have a folder called **sample-theme** and inside that folder you have another file called **sample-theme.json** with the following contents:

```
{
    "name": "Sample Theme",
    "version": "1.0"
}
```

This package will detect this as a new theme. You can also include a sample screenshot of your theme, which would be **sample-theme.jpg** *(800x500px) for best results*

In fact, you can checkout the sample-theme repo here: [https://github.com/thedevdojo/sample-theme](https://github.com/thedevdojo/sample-theme)

You can activate this theme by setting the `active` column to 1 for that specific theme. Then use it like:

```
return view('theme::welcome')
```

This will then look in the current active theme folder for a new view called `welcome.blade.php` :D

## Theme Configs

You may choose to publish a config to your project by running:

```
php artisan vendor:publish
```

You will want to publish the themes config, and you will now see a new config located at `config/themes.php`, which will look like the following:

```
<?php

return [

    'folder' => resource_path('themes'),
    'publish_assets' => true,
    'create_tables' => true

];
```

Now, you can choose an alternate location for your themes folder. By default this will be put into the `resources` folder; however, you can change that to any location you would like.

> Warning, If you add the themes folder into the `resources/views` folder and you run `php artisan optimize` you may get an error that it cannot find certain components. This is because it will search all the `.blade.php` files inside the views folder. So, this may not be the best place to put your themes. Instead this package will register only the views of the active theme.

Additionally, you can set **publish_assets** to *true* or *false*, if it is set to *true* anytime the themes directory is scanned it will publish the `assets` folder in your theme to the public folder inside a new `themes` folder. Set this to *false* and this will no longer happen.
